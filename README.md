# Build Your Own Telegraf

Telegraf isn't a huge binary, it's under 100MiB. However, we can make that smaller.

Telegraf ships with A LOT of plugins for supporting all of our users use-cases, but each individidual user only needs around 4/5 plugins.

This tooling aims to make it as simple as pie to build your own custom Telegraf Docker image.

## Requirements

You need Docker

## Getting Started

### Dockerfile

Provide a Dockerfile. You can use any base layer you want, even scratch. I'm using Alpine.

```Dockerfile
FROM rawkode/telegraf:byo AS build

FROM alpine:3.7 AS telegraf

COPY --from=build /go/src/github.com/influxdata/telegraf/telegraf /bin/telegraf
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/telegraf" ]
```

### Config

Provide a `build.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
    input = [
        "prometheus"
    ]

    output = [
        "influxdb"
    ]
```

**NB:  Providing an empty array for either will build with ALL plugins for that type [input|output].**


### Build Docker Image

`docker image build --tag your_image_name --build-arg VERSION=1.10 .`
